So how we have shit set up what's going to happen is that the page is only going to be
loaded once (index.html). After that we are going to load smaller pages on top of that page to
change the content (partials). This is where the partials go so we can keep track of them.
Feel free to organize them into sub-categories for easier maintenance.
